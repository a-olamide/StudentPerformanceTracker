## üß† OOP Concepts & Design Patterns Demonstrated

| Concept / Pattern     | Where Used                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation**     | All model classes (e.g., `Student`, `Subject`)       |
| **Abstraction**       | Repositories & Services (`StudentRepository`, etc.)  |
| **Polymorphism**      | `GradeReportStrategy` interface & implementations    |
| **Composition**       | Models containing other objects via IDs              |
| **Association**       | Student ‚ÜîÔ∏è Grades, Subject ‚ÜîÔ∏è Grades                   |
| **Repository Pattern**| CRUD operations for DB access                        |
| **Factory Pattern**   | `ViewFactory` returns correct form screen            |
| **Strategy Pattern**  | Export logic switch (CSV vs Console)                 |
| **Singleton Pattern** | `DbConnectionManager` ensures single DB instance     |
